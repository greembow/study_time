# study_time
A simple study timer for linux written in rust.
I took this project on as a way to learn the basics of rust.
Soon enough more will be added, it is very barebones at the moment.

## Features to come:
- Proper error handling
- command argument parsing
- config file
- the ability to block web adresses as well
