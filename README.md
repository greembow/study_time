# study_time
A simple study timer for linux written in rust.
I took this project on as a way to learn the basics of rust.
Soon enough more will be added, it is very barebones at the moment.

## Why so long between commits?
I'm a busy girl that's still in school. I don't have a lot of time to improve this code. Hopefully with v0.2.0 some of the features I added can be leveraged to better use my time and get commits out on a decent schedule

## Features to come:
- Proper error handling (somewhat implemented in 0.2.0)
- ~~command argument parsing~~ (implemented in 0.2.0)
- config file
- the ability to block web adresses as well
